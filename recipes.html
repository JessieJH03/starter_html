        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <h1>Swedish Pancakes</h1>
        <span>Origin: Sweden</span>
        <span>Source: <a href="https://true-north-kitchen.com/swedish-pancakes-with-lingonberries/">The North Kitchen</a></span>
        <span>Category: Breakfast</span>
        <img src="images/swedish-pancakes-platted.jpg" width="400" alt="Platted Swedish Pancakes">
        <p>Swedish pancakes (Pannkaka [singular] or Pannkakor [plural] in Swedish) are one of the most well-known Scandinavian delicacies, and rightfully so. Tender, buttery and often served with butter and lingonberry jam, there is much to account for their popularity.</p>

        <h2>Recipe Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Flour</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add Â¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.  Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other desired toppings and/or fillings. See notes below for more information about making ahead of time and storing in the refrigerator or freezer.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Chicken Curry</h1>
        <span>Origin: Japan</span>
        <span>Source: Family Recipe</span>
        <span>Category: Entry</span>
        <img src="images/Curry_Japanese_Chicken_Curry.jpg" width="400" alt="Japanese Chicken Curry">
        <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. It's an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p>

        <h2>Recipe Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and ground black peper to taste</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
            <li>1 can peas</li>
            <li>5 potatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1 package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.</li>
        </ol>
